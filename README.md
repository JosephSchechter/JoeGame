My current project- making a 2d ARPG

Currently, I have a character drawn from a sprite that can walk around in a user-defined or randomly generated map made of 16x16 pixel tiles
he has collision detection on special tile types
he can shoot and it has kb/mouse integration

in the future:
multiplayer support
character classes
various projectile types
other mob characters
I will implement my own sprites, and not use other people's drawings

this is based off the 2D game making tutorial from TheCherno
